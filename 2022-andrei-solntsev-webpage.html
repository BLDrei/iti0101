    <article>Probably will need this for exam. <br>
        Strachey wrote a checkers program for the Ferranti Mark I at
        Manchester (with Turing's encouragement and utilising the
        latter's recently completed Programmers' Handbook for the
        Ferranti computer). By the summer of 1952 this program could,
        Strachey reported, "play a complete game of Draughts at a
        reasonable speed".
         Prinz's chess program, also written for the Ferranti Mark I,
        first ran in November 1951. It was for solving simple problems
        of the mate-in-two variety. The program would examine every
        possible move until a solution was found. On average several
        thousand moves had to be examined in the course of solving a
        problem, and the program was considerably slower than a
        human player.
         Turing started to program his Turochamp chess-player on
        the Ferranti Mark I but never completed the task. Unlike Prinz's
        program, the Turochamp could play a complete game and
        operated not by exhaustive search but under the guidance of
        rule-of-thumb principles devised by Turing.</article>
